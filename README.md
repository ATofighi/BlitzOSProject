The BLITZ System is a collection of software designed to support a university-level course on Operating Systems. Over the course of one or two terms, students will implement a small, but complete, operating system kernel. The BLITZ software provides the framework for these student projects.

Unfortunately the original version don't work in 64bit operating systems; I modify the source code to support new operating systems.
